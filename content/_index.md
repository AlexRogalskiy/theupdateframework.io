The Update Framework (**TUF**) helps developers maintain the security of software update systems, providing protection even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible framework and [specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#the-update-framework-specification) that developers can adopt into any software update system.

TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) (CNCF) and is used in production by companies such as Cloudflare, Datadog, Docker, DigitalOcean, Flynn, IBM, Microsoft, LEAP, Kolide, and VMware. A variant of TUF called [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is widely used to secure over-the-air updates in automobiles.
